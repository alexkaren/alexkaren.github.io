So far in CS1, I have learned the basics of coding with Sublime Text. I learned about the layout of Sublime Text, what everything looks like and means, and how to use CSS in the style section. I also learned how to make a personcard. I’m feeling pretty good about everything but there is still a lot I have to learn. Right now I am working on my website, specifically figuring out how to format it. I am very excited to see the final product for my website. Something that is frustrating me is that there are still some minor errors that I don’t know how to fix. In the upcoming weeks, I am hoping to finish my website and publish it.</p>

I just encountered a problem with my website that neither I nor Ms. Josephs can seem to figure out. When trying to make it so that by clicking on the shark it takes you to my journal, but for some reason, the shark disappeared and no matter where you click on the website, it takes you to the journal. Also, when we put a background color on the shark, the tip of a second shark also showed. After trying to figure it out in class, we could not come to a reasonable conclusion. Hopefully, I fix it soon because it is very frustrating.</p>

After going through this checklist, I have everything that I need to know and have done. The only thing I didn’t fully understand was arrays, but after making a lab and talking to my classmates, I think I have it down. Specifically, I was having trouble with the math randomizer but I know it now. I feel good about everything that we’ve done so far and am ready to learn more.</p>

For my Christmas present, I made a Christmas tree for my sister with designable ornaments to be put on the tree. I used her hobbies, pictures of her, pictures of the family, and general Christmas decorations. I haven’t given it to her yet, but I think she will love it. I did this project by making a separate div for the tree and each of the ornaments while using arrays and event listeners. I hope she loves it!</p>

Today in class Avi and I presented our slideshow on Emojis and how they work. We talked about how a Japanese man named Shigetaka Kurita created them in 1999 so that you could fit more into an email with a 250 character limit. He made them on a 12x12 design which he found difficult because there was no center point. Now, however, because of vector graphics they can work with as many pixels as they want. One fact I found really interesting was that there was no third-party group involved at the beginning and Kurita and his team could publish whatever emojis they wanted to. Overall I really enjoyed researching this topic.</p>

This week we have been working on new projects in class and at home. I am making Madlibs. My plan is to have alert boxes that ask for different parts of speech (verbs, adjectives, nouns, adverbs, names, etc.). These alert boxes will all come up separately before any text appears on the screen. After all the questions have been answered, the finished madlib will appear on the screen with all the empty boxes filled in. My brother loves Madlibs, so as soon as I finish I will show it to him. Im not done yet because I still need to figure out how to sequence the alert boxes, but I am excited for the end result. </p>

For the past week and a half, I have been working on my madlib project. Since I first started, I have finished writing two of my scripts and have started to figure out the code for the rest of the website. One problem I encountered was that my word submissions went on a completely separate line, so I was able to fix that problem by using spans as opposed to divs. Another problem I encountered was that when I answered for the first adjective, it plugged in that response for all following adjectives, but I fixed that problem by changing the wording for the span ids. I should be done soon and I'm excited to see my results. </p>

After working on it on and off for a month, I finally finished my madlibs project. I have three separate madlibs, one revolving around school, one revolving around the zoo, and a third revolving around the ocean. I wrote two other scripts, but I didn't like them and just ran with those three. I faced some problems trying to differentiate the three different websites, but I think I did a god job. I'm excited to show it to my younger brother and sister and see their reactions! </p>

It's been a while since I last entered in this journal but I recently finished a ping pong related game. Molly showed us a corona virus game, and I decided to make a spinoff of that game using something that had been of interest to me, ping pong. There was a ping pong table added to the 14th floor recently, so I figured I would make a game relating to it. The way the game works is that there is a ping pong paddle that follows your mouse, and you have to click on ping pong balls to hit them away. I showed it to my sister and she thought it was cool, so I'm happy with the finished result! </p>

Hey, Journal. I haven't finished any more projects yet, but today I pushed my ping pong game and my madlibs. I showed these two projects to my two younger siblings and they both found them really cool! The last project I tried to make for my sister didn't end up working, so I'm glad she enjoyed these projects. As the year is nearing its end, I'm brainstorming what my final project could be about. As of now, my projects don't connect to many life experiences other than my friends, so something revolving around my social life is my only idea. </p>

Hi journal, today Avi and I finished our presentation. Our topic of choice is revolving around the school system, specifically Dalton, and the negative effect it has on our social life. When it became time to start working on our final projects, neither Avi nor I had an idea. After talking about it for a minute, we got the idea to do a joint presentation and were able to convince Molly. I'm excited to give this presentation that will serve as a lid for all the discussions we've had this year. </p>

Today, Avi and I gave our final presentation. We gave our presentation revolving around the problems with the school system. In our presentation we cited harvard graduates and professors. We also wanted to include an Andrew Tate video, but Molly said no to it. We talked about how the amount of stress and lack of academic freedom that this school gives us leads to our work eventually being worse. Throughout the year, we had talked about this topic in recurring conversations, so it was good to put all of it together for our final project. </p>
